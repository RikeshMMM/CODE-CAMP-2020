### How anamay keeps himself motivated?

Self Motivation is what drives me to be better everyday. Knowing the fact that my hard work and perseverance will help me to achieve greater professional success. Life is very short to experience everything, so it's better to learn from otherâ€™s experiences(both
failure and success) and do something that can add value to society.

> ### Motivation Quote
> Never give up. Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine
