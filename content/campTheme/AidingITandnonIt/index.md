# **Overview**

As the lockdown was announced, most IT and non-IT companies were not prepared to face it. Enabling work from home required arrangements to be made and lack of preparation paved the way for severe consequences. India experienced many layoffs. Drifting from face-to-face to online meeting was not easy for both IT and non-IT companies. Work from home culture is misused by many of the employees. Many times, the employees are not available in person but are online and their seniors are unaware of this. This is how they misuse it. Companies have witnessed loss of productivity due to the work from home culture. It is a problem for both employees and employers of both IT and non-IT companies. Can you help these companies to make sure that these issues are not faced by their employees? 
Some examples of software would include monitoring tool of activity of employees, performance analytics tool, performance monitoring tool, monitoring of mail time spent and meeting time spent, active time calculation, etc.
