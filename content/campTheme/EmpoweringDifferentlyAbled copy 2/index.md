# **Overview**

Some people are forced to confine themselves in their rooms. No they are not introverts, they want to come out but harassment and  lack of social support makes them timid. Among them, some can't speak for their concerns, some can't listen, some can't walk and the most affected are the ones with mental disability. Being disabled doesn't mean being less abled, it simply means being differently-abled from the rest. They need our help to prove this fact and it is said that if one is good in even a single thing, the world needs him. John Nash got the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. The biggest example in the history is the author of 'A brief history of time'. If you look around yourself, you'll find more of them. The world needs them more than majority of us. Can you bring them out of their rooms into the mainstream?

# **Example**

Helping deaf and dumb people in communication, creating awareness about government schemes for differently abled.
